Project: Custom Discord Bot using Discord.js in JavaScript

Guidelines for AI Assistance:
- Utilize the latest Discord.js features, including slash commands and interactions.
- Adhere to modern JavaScript standards (ES6+), using async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Structure code modularly for scalability, such as separate files for commands and event listeners.
- Implement robust error handling for all asynchronous operations with try/catch or .catch().
- Use environment variables for sensitive data like API tokens, never hardcoding them.
- Include explanatory comments in generated code to clarify functionality.
- Suggest logging mechanisms (e.g., console.log or a logging library) for monitoring and debugging.
- Ensure code compatibility with Node.js and specify necessary dependencies (e.g., discord.js).
- Provide examples for registering and handling slash commands with the Discord API.
- Include permission checks for commands that require specific user roles or permissions.
